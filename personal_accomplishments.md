After watching a documentary about the early history of Super Smash Bros. Melee in late 2017, I decided to give the game a try. At first, I spent months practicing alone, driven by curiosity to see how far I could push myself. But when I finally reached out to the local Montana scene, I quickly realized that my practice was inadequate. I learned that growth in Melee wasn’t just individual — it was about learning and growing <i>with</i> others. Over the years, the community that whooped me has become more than rivals; they’ve become my friends, my support system, and the people whom have grown with me in a shared bond, both in-game and in life. I take pride in being ranked on the Montana PR: it is an achievement I will cherish forever, but I find myself cherishing moreso the personal growth and friendships I’ve gained along the way.
